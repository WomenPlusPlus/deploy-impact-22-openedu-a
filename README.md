# deploy-impact-22-openedu-a
Repository for Team openedu-a for deploy(impact) 2022
- Our team's deliverables are organized in the following miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPEqW2rg=/?share_link_id=724480048879
- The miro board consists of 42 frames under the Deliverables section which includes our teams work throughout the project. 
- To follow them in the correct order, first go to Introduction to Deliverables frame where you can see the main sections, namely, organization, User Research, Market - Research, Uploading Procedure, Moderation System, Ontology, and Architecture. 
- You can either follow them in the given order or you can directly go to the frame by clicking on the little blue arrow on the title of the specific section. 
- There is also the option to view the frames in a presenter mode, which we recommend. On the bottom left side of the board there is an option to extend the side bar. After clicking, on the top left there is a blue play button. This will direct you to the presentation mode and let you view the frames in order. 
- Our presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tUf_pNSoUQWT7NSF8t4eI0QwaeYD97NeMyF4MlbAxHA/edit#slide=id.g1972e597711_0_18
